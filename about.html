      <p class="about">
        I'm a software engineer and have been working in the media space since
        the beginning of my career. I started at a startup, where I worked on
        social media analytics, intelligent brand discovery and categorization,
        and a box office prediction system. After that, I moved to a large tech
        company to work on media sharing in a cloud storage product. In my
        current role, I started with root of trust firmware attestations and
        secure boot for multi root of trust systems, before moving to the
        browser content protection team. Now, I focus on the browser's Content
        Decryption Module (CDM) for premium video and audio, working to help
        content providers reach their audience seamlessly and ensure a smooth,
        uninterrupted experience for our users.
